## Introduction to Application

Defogging is an innovative city exploration app that transforms urban exploration into an engaging adventure. Inspired by the fog-of-war concept from MOBA games, the app encourages users to discover their city by physically moving through different neighborhoods. As users explore, they clear the fog on the map, earn Familiarity Points, unlock special events, and collect rewards. The app combines gamification elements with practical navigation, making city exploration more exciting and rewarding. It features a user-friendly interface, real-time location tracking, and social sharing capabilities, allowing users to document and share their exploration journey with friends. Defogging aims to promote outdoor activity, local discovery, and community engagement through an interactive and enjoyable experience.
