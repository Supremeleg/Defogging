# Defogging -- Open the Unknown

**Defogging** is a gamified exploration app that transforms your city—whether home or away—into an ever‑unfolding adventure. Borrowing the *fog‑of‑war* concept from MOBA games, every neighborhood starts out hidden. Walk, cycle, or ride through the streets to **defog** new blocks, earn **Familiarity Points**, unlock **events**, and collect **rewards**. It's not just navigation—it's discovery.
